## What is Google Foobar Challenge?
[Google Foobar Challenge](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/) is Google's secret recruiting process embedded within their search engine. There are 5 levels, each with a different number of challenges that follow a story (9 on total).

It was a fun challenge that made me learn some new theorems and review some old ones that I completely forgot!

### LEVEL 1
* [Solar Doomsday](https://github.com/andrefpoliveira/google-foobar-challenge/tree/main/Level%201/Solar%20Doomsday)

## The end
* [Decrypting Code](https://github.com/andrefpoliveira/google-foobar-challenge/tree/main/The%20End)  

At the end, you receive and encryted text just like this one:
```GkkXBwZNAxofTlBfDlcOHBEOWkhASVEGBh4NBA8DBwAJRlNMThUWWhUMAxELCUNMThMDDx0TFR1D Ul8OQQACCgIAShkLAhFIAk9LCBUNABcXBAMBHBEJRlNMTgULQh8KBRELCUNMTgQECxAIFR1DUl8O QRoNDxVCAlBOCBsACU9WSVESABxARhM=```

Because of the `=` sign at the end I thought of base64 encryption. I just needed to find the key... ðŸ¤”  
There was a line at the end saying `For *your* eyes only!`... Well what could it be...  
The key was my username on the challenge: `andre.filipe.pinto.oliveira`!

After decrypting the message you get:
```{'success' : 'great', 'colleague' : 'esteemed', 'efforts' : 'incredible', 'achievement' : 'unlocked', 'rabbits' : 'safe', 'foo' : 'win!'}```

You can still request for a new challenge at the end what is great ðŸ¤©
